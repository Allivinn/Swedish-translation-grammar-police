# GrammarPolice-Translations
This repository contains all the language files for GrammarPolice. <br>
GrammarPolice uses the Microsoft Speech Platform, which allows GrammarPolice to use a range of languages. In order for GrammarPolice to support each language, files need to be translated into that language first.

ℹ️ When GrammarPolice is updated, these files are included. Users can make a contribution to GrammarPolice to improve its language compatibility.<br><br>

## Want to contribute a translation?
All contributions are appreciated. Please try to keep translations as accurate as possible, as they will be used by other people.

If you are contributing to a new language, you will need to:
1. Create a new folder to match your language code and follow the folder structure.
2. Translate the files to your language in your new folder.
3. Update the README file with a tick.
4. **Submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for it to be added.**
